## The Problem it solves ☮️
Hobbies Community: This project aims to build an online community hub for individuals with diverse hobbies to connect, share experiences, and engage with like-minded individuals. This platform will foster interaction, create a sense of belonging, and provide a vibrant space for community building.

## Challenges we ran into 🕊️
We faced numerous challenges throughout the journey. We used AWS services. But we all were new to it. Sometimes it is the connection issues and sometimes it’s our lack of experience in integration feature. It took a lot of time to overcome this issue. After this we have faced issues while writing codes for responsive design. Sometimes the components were distorted and moved from their places. It took time to place them in their right position. Placing the elements in their position and designing for responsiveness was our big challenge.
   
## How we built it!?🧠
We used React.js in the frontend. We have used Shadcn for forms, contents and for some components like buttons and illustrations for our website. We used undraw website for some of the illustrations. We used AWS services and used Gmeet for further discussions on content and screens. We used look a to design logo for our app.
